- add specific tests to differentiate generate_person and generate_people, including calc_age tests
- add tests for the calc_age functions
- specify `tic` units (days, years, etc. to calculate rates effectively)
- add an `update_traits` function that can be quite flexible
- make `calc_fertility_agespec`, `calc_mortality_agespec`, etc. age-specific fertility and mortality, including mortality and fertility schedules
- incorporate a calc_attractiveness function into select_mates, and also allow for bilateral decisions (e.g. both swipe right)
